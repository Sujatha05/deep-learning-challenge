                 Read the  charity_data.csv' to a Pandas dataframe.
                 Drop the EIN and the NAME column
                 Determine the number of unique values for each column.
                 set the cutoff value for the application_type and classification column.
                 Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model and determined the accuracy and loss.
                 Exported the model to the AlphabetSoupCharity.h5
